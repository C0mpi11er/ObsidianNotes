vuln is sometimes called https parameter pollution aka WAF bypass technique 

Some systems contain internal APIs that aren't directly accessible from the internet. Server-side parameter pollution occurs when a website embeds user input in a server-side request to an internal API without adequate encoding. This means that an attacker may be able to manipulate or inject parameters, which may enable them to, for example:

- Override existing parameters.
- Modify the application behavior.
- Access unauthorized data.
- 
u can use a URL-encoded `#` character to attempt to truncate the server-side request. To help you interpret the response, you could also add a string after the `#` character.

For example, you could modify the query string to the following:

`GET /userSearch?name=peter%23foo&back=/home`

The front-end will try to access the following URL:

`GET /users/search?name=peter#foo&publicProfile=true`

->> note if error isnt not return server side was truncated and thus can return a non public profile 
sometime the apllication ignores it which requites you to test further 

To confirm whether the application is vulnerable to server-side parameter pollution, you could try to override the original parameter. Do this by injecting a second parameter with the same name.

For example, you could modify the query string to the following:

`GET /userSearch?name=peter%26name=carlos&back=/home`

This results in the following server-side request to the internal API:

`GET /users/search?name=peter&name=carlos&publicProfile=true`


- PHP parses the last parameter only. This would result in a user search for `carlos`.
- ASP.NET combines both parameters. This would result in a user search for `peter,carlos`, which might result in an `Invalid username` error message.
- Node.js / express parses the first parameter only. This would result in a user search for `peter`, giving an unchanged result.
- 
->> if second param is overidden one can perform an exploit e.g administrator 





## Preventing server-side parameter pollution

To prevent server-side parameter pollution, use an allowlist to define characters that don't need encoding, and make sure all other user input is encoded before it's included in a server-side request. You should also make sure that all input adheres to the expected format and structure.
